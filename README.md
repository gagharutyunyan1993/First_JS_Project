# first_project
It's the first web page that i make for learning JS by testing in it.

I make scripts for:
1) adding calculator for calculate ticket price 
2) adding tabs by js
3) adding slider for photos
4) adding countdown timer to your page
5) adding modal window by js
6) adding form in modal window and send ajax requests
